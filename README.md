# Todo App

Welcome to the Todo App! This is a simple Angular application that allows you to manage your daily tasks efficiently. It provides features to add, edit, and delete tasks, and helps you keep track of what you need to accomplish.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks based on their status (all, active, completed)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (You can install it globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathapreddy0227/todo-app-angular.git
cd todo-app-angular
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application
